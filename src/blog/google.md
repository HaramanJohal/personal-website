This book was on ONI’s recommended reading list for managers. I am not usually in the market for this kind of book about a business, but I got through this book very quickly and enjoyed it.

There were many useful ideas, some in fact about encouraging good ideas and building the best product around a technical insights (exponential innovation) rather than around customer requests (linear incremental improvement). These jump out at me more right now given the fact we are starting a year with new ideas and thinking deeply about our products. 

I’m sure I’ll also carry some of the hiring and people insights into the coming year too. One of the recurring themes was the profile of the ideal smart creative employee. I wonder how narrow a category this is.

An interesting note near the start mentioned an employee at Google mentioning to the authors that this was how Google used to work rather than its current state. I wonder how much you can really know the culture of a company of this scale, Google has certainly done a better than average job of creating a distinctive work environment, but I’d be interested to know how much local/departmental distance creates cultural divides in organisations this big. How much does the average Google employee relate to the values in this book?
