Finally summoned the willpower to try out a textile craft after (as usual) many years of theoretically being interested in them. It was pretty incredible to pull repeatedly at a length of yarn with a small hook and end up with a useful piece of clothing. Got some helpful pointers and encouragement at several key moments from Mum, who is an outstanding crocheter and knitter. It was nice to share this kind of hobby with her (though it was accompanied by the usual complaining that I would show her up).

The uniformity of the grid patterns appealed to my preference for lower entropy states. I also found the repetitive actions very absorbing and can add this to the list of activities that pair nicely with listening to podcasts (the list is long).

When laid flat the scarf makes a neat semicircular arc. It seems, though I got more relaxed through the project, the stitch tension increased. Luckily it seems to have increased consistently so it even seems somewhat intentional.

This was the perfect size for a free time diversion, the goal was achievable. By starting with the simplest possible scarf pattern (all single crochets) I could find online, I was able to increase the complexity to a level I was happy with by adding more elaborate stitches in the middle (alpine pattern). It felt really good to finish a side project in such a contained time. I suspect the drive to make the scarf as a gift for someone else helped too.

Adding a pompom to each corner was a very high joy/effort activity. If you ever get the opportunity to add pompoms to something in life, donâ€™t hold back. In future I may attempt something like a rug or a jumper.
